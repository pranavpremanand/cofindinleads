    html: `
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
  Living in a bustling city doesn't mean you have to leave your eco-conscious values behind. In fact, urban sustainability is becoming more critical than ever as cities continue to expand and populations grow. The good news? You don't need to live off-grid to live green.
  From embracing smart home technology to supporting local green initiatives, there are plenty of ways to make city living more sustainable‚Äîand even more convenient. In this blog post, we'll explore practical tips and eco-friendly technologies you can adopt today to reduce your carbon footprint, save money, and contribute to a healthier planet.

</p>

<h2 class="text-lg font-bold mt-8 mb-4">üèôÔ∏è Why Sustainable Urban Living Matters</h2>
<ul class="space-y-2 list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
  <li>Cities account for over 70% of global carbon emissions, yet they only occupy about 3% of the Earth's surface. That's a big impact from a small space.</li>

  <li><strong>What You Can Do:</strong>
    <ul class="space-y-2 list-disc pl-6">
      <li>Choose electric or hybrid vehicles</li>
